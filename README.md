# Untitled-Space-Game

## Overview

### Game Summary
You travel space in your trusty space ship as you both face the dreaded fate of incoming meteors!

### Project Description
This is a Godot based project that is a simple game where you control a space ship and have to defend the Earth against
incoming meteors, that will cause permanent damage to the Earth if they are not destroyed. 

## Usage

### Warning!
This project was originally developed in a version of Godot 3. Godot recently launched Godot 4. However, this project currently breaks when imported into Godot 4 and opening it with a previous version of Godot (any version before Godot 4) after it has been made to be compatible with a Godot 4 is not possbile. As such, **DO NOT OPEN THIS PROJECT IN GODOT 4**, unless you are sure that you want to do so.  
If you do have Godot 4 but would still like to go through the source code, I recommend downloading a version of [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org/download/3.x/windows/), and opening it using that installation.  
Support for Godot 4 is intended to come in the future (possibly via a different repository), but for now this project works best when used in a version of Godot 3.

### Instructions
- Download and install the Godot Game Engine (A version of [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org/download/3.x/windows/) is recommended).
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open Godot, and from the Project Manager window, choose to import a new project.
- Using the browse option in the dialog box that now appears, navigate to the directory where you cloned this project (go into the project's directory to find the file that is mentioned in the next step).
- Click the **project.godot** file and click Open.
- Now, back in the Project Manager window, choose to Edit the project.
